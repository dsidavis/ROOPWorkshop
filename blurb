In this workshop, we'll discuss object-oriented concepts in R.  We'll
cover the concepts provided by the S3, S4, Reference classes and S6
mechanisms.  We'll talk about how to understand and work with them, use them
when developing functions and methods, and in the context of
packages. This will cover making code extensible and customizable.  As
always, we hope to have a lot of discussion of concepts and best
practices.
