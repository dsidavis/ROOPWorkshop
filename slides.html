# Object Oriented Programming

+ Classes are everywhere in R and important to understand them.

+ R modeling software built on simple object oriented mechanism.

+ Generic functions.

+ Extensible.

+ Good software design mechanism.
  + Reduces repeating code.


---

# OOP

+ Helps to provide structure
  + conceptually for author and user

+ Queryable structure rather than just reading the code

+ Provides extra checks

+ Enables code to behave differently without changing it!
  + Customizable and extensible.
  + Don't have to own code
  + Don't break code.

+ Encourages high-level programming above implementation details.
  + Delegate implementation/representation specific code to help methods.

+ Encourages smaller, more focused functions.

---

# OOP in R

## Functional
+ S3
+ S4

## Mutable (!)
+ Reference classes
+ R6, ...


# Dispatch
+ Single (S3, R6)
+ Multi S4

---
# Functional versus Reference

+ Functional programming
   + no side effects

+ Key is that pass the same inputs to a function, get the same result.
   + Not changing state

+ Haskell and other languages

+ R is "98%" functional.
  + Not quite because
     + global variables
     + environments,
     + options(),
     + graphics devices,
     + connections,
     + external pointers
     + random number generator

+ Related to pass by value
   + pass object to function
   + function changes object
   + no change in caller for original object
   + caller does not see changes
      + unless object is returned
      + but separate object

+ Much easier to reason about code
   + fewer bugs
   + easier to track how something changed

---

# References

+ pass inputs by reference to a function
+ function makes change
+ caller sees thos changes
   + whether wants to or not.

+ Benefits
   + avoids copies.
   + makes it easy to return multiplee values
     + one return value
     + but also communicate changes to inputs
   + update state across calls

+ Can do this with closures
+ Reference classes in Python, Java, C++
   + methods can change fields in object.

+ Downsides
   + Hard to find bugs
   + Hard to reason where something changed
     + deep in the call stack

---

# Key Concepts

+ Generic functions & methods
+ Semi-Structured and fully-Structured class definitions
   + S3 versus S4.

---

# What do classes & methods solve?

+ Users call one function that behaves differently based on the types of the inputs/arguments.
   + Users only have to remember one verb, not complex function names.
+ Separate code for different types of input into separate functions.
+ Override, extend functionality for one or more types.
  + reuse code.
+ Inherit code (methods) from other
+ Relationships between class hierarchies.


---

# Bad Approach to Generic Functions

+ Functions can check the class label
```
if(class(x) == "matrix")
  # do something specific for matrix...
```

+ Class vector may have more than one label, e.g. POSIXt and POSIXlt
```
 "matrix" %in% class(x)
```
or better
```
  inherits(x, 'matrix')
  is(x, 'matrix')
```
+ inherits() in base R
+ is() in methods package

---

+ Handle 2 or more classes differently

+ 
```
if(is(x, "matrix")) {

} else if(is(x, "data.frame")) {

} else {
  # default computation
}
``

+ This allows code to behave differently depending on its input.

+ So user can call one function, but it behaves differently based on the
type of one input.

---
# Better Approach - Method Dispatch

+ Consider idiom
```
myFun = function(x) {
    if(inherits(x, 'A')) ...
    else if(inherits(x, 'B')) ...
    else if(inherits(x, 'C')) ...
    else  ...  # default
}
```

+ The collection if() statements can become long and hard to read and maintain.

+ What if we want to introduce a new class 'D'?
```
else if(inherits(x, 'D')) ...
else ...
```

+ But have to modify original function.
  + What if it is in a package?
  + Or we don't own the function?

---

# Better Approach

+ Separate code for each class

+
```
myFun.A = function(x) ...
myFun.B = function(x) ...
myFun.C = function(x) ...
myFun.default = function(x) ...
```

+ R looks at myFun and finds appropriate *method* based on class of x.

+ Define **generic** myFun() as
```
myFun = function(x, ...) UseMethod("myFun")
```

---

# S3

+ Query the class of an object with `class(x)`
   + Different from `typeof(x)`

+ class() is conceptual, what does it represent
   + not implementation or "how constructed"

+ just label(s)
   + no restriction (or guarantee) on content and structure.
   + just implicit that it makes sense.

+ Very different from C++, Java.

+ Put a class on an object
```
class(pi) = "A"
```
+ can be a vector class labels, not just one
```
class(obj) = c("A", "B")
```
   + order matters

---

# Generic Functions

+ Basic verb/action
  + Implementation is different for different types
  + Returns the same conceptual result.

+ dim(), plot(), dim(), summary(), ..

---
# Benefit of Generic Functions

+ If the computations in a function call generic functions
  + can accept different inputs.
  + will behave appropriately for those inputs.


---
# Top 50 Generic Functions

+ i.e. most methods in R packages on CRAN
+ 11,851 unique generic functions.

# Generic Function Examples

+ Fit a linear model
```
m = lm(mpg ~ wt, mtcars)
class(m)
```

+ abline() understands about linear models
```
plot(mpg ~ wt, mtcars)
abline(m)
```

+ Plot knows about about linear models
```
plot(m)
```


+ coef()
```
coef(m)
residuals(m)
```

---
# A regression tree model
```
tr = rpart::rpart(mpg ~ wt, mtcars)
residuals(tr)
```

```
plot(tr)
text(tr)
```

---

# 2 Classes

```
now = Sys.time()
class(now)
```

```
typeof(now)
```


+ Note: the print() method takes care of displaying this appropriately.

---

# S3 Dispatch
## How does R find an S3 method?

+ Only happens for generic functions
  + Body is `UseMethod("myGenericFunName")`


+ In generic function
   + R computes class() vector -
   + essentially computes fun.className for all class names of obj & "default"
```
paste(genericName, c(class(obj), "default"), sep = ".")
```
   + for each of these, searches for a function (in package or search() path)
   + stops when it finds a function
   + invokes that function

---
# Turning a Function into a Generic with Methods

+ Existing function
```
foo =
function(x, y, col = "red")
{
  # ....
}
```
+ Create generic (not quite)
```
foo =
function(x, y, col = "red")
{
   UseMethod("foo")
}
```

+ Add ... to parameters.
+ Should think about whether parameters are suitable for all methods
   + Absorb some of the original parameters that are method specific into ...

+ Redefine original function as foo.default, or a for a specific class.

+ So full sequence:
```
foo.default = foo
foo =
function(x, ...)
{
   UseMethod("foo")
}
```

+ Define other methods
```
foo.matrix =
function(x, col = "red", ...)
{

}
```
---

# Developing a Method
## Example

```
library(Rtesseract)
ts = tesseract("Bardos-1975_1.jpg")
plot(ts)
```

+ plot() method for tesseract object
```
class(ts)
[1] "TesseractBaseAPI"
attr(,"package")
[1] "Rtesseract"
```

+ If we compute the locations of the OCR elements with
```
bb = GetBoxes("Bardos-1975_1.jpg")
```
then harder to plot
```
Rtesseract:::plot.OCR( bbox = bb, filename = "Bardos-1975_1.jpg")
```

+ And we want a version that shows the recovered text, not the image.
---

# An Approach

+ Put a class on a general data.frame,
+ provide a method for plot() for this class.


+ Example: Optical Character Recognition results
```
class(bb)
```

+ Set the class
```
class(bb) = c("OCRResults", class(bb))
```

+ Define a plot method as `plot.OCRResults`
```
plot.OCRResults =
function(x, y, cex = 1, ...)
{
    plot(0, type = "n", xlim = range(c(x$left, x$right)) * c(.95, 1.05),
           ylim = range(c(x$top, x$bottom))*c(.95, 1.05), xlab = "", ylab = "")

    h = max(x$top)
    text(x$left, h - x$bottom, x$text, adj = c(0, 0), cex = cex)
}
```

---

# Notes

+ Note that bb is still a data.frame.

+ Still obeys bb$top, bb[, "top"], etc.

+ If we remove plot.OCRResults, will use plot method for data.frame
```
rm(plot.OCRResults)
plot(bb)
```

---
+ ... in Generic Function

+ Good idea to add ... in generic function
+ Allows methods to define additional parameters.

---

# S3 - single dispatch.

+ Looks at class of only one argument - typically first.
+ Can't define a method for, e.g.,
```
   x - character &  y -  matrix
   x - list      &  y - data.frame
   x - list      &  y - missing    &  z - missing
```

+ Need S4 to do this




---
# Packages, Exporting Classes &amp; Methods

+ export generic functions
+ S3method()


---
# S4

+ Formal definitions of classes, methods
+ Provides more reliable, verifiable structure to code
  + errors are caught

+ Can query
   + what classes are defined
   + structure of all objects from a class
   + relationships between the classes

+ Test validity of an instance
  + Not just structure, but content.
  + e.g.
     + all slots have same length
     + all starts are ealier than ends
     + all values are positive
     + black and white image has no color
  
+ Abstract or virtual classes
+ Classes that are instance of one of several classes.


---
# S4 Functions

+ setClass()
+ setGeneric()
+ setMethod()
+ setAs()

---
# Defining Classes

+ Define classes formally
  + Not just label, but structure

+ A class has "slots"
  + data stored in the object,
  + each slot has name and a type

```
Bob = setClass("Bob", slots = list(x = "integer", y = "numeric"))
```

+ Create new objects with constructor function or new()
```
b = Bob(x = 10L, y = pi)
b = new("Bob", x = 10L, y = pi)
```
---
# Ensures structure

+ Can't create an object with slots of wrong type.

+ Compare with S3
  + can put anything into a field
  + can create new fields on the fly.
  + just implicit "contract" to have object with elements that make sense.

+ Validity method on class arbitrary function that checks content, not just structure.

---
# setClass() Example


+ [raster package]()
+ [lubridate package]()


---
# setClass() Example

+ Degree
  + Celcius
  + Faranheit
  + Kelvin
  + Rankine

+ Also latitude and longitude.
  + Have to think about how to represent these - degrees and minutes
  + How to clearly separate from temperature.

# as() and coercion - setAs()

+ register a method for converting from one class 
```
setAs(fromClassName, toClassName, function(from) ...)
```

+ Once registered, use as
```
as(ts, "Pix")
```
```
doc = as(filename, "PDFToXMLDoc")
```

+ Contrast with
```
if(as(doc, "character"))
  doc = readPDFXML(doc)
```
or worse
```
if(as(doc, "character"))
  doc = readPDFXML(doc)
else if(is(doc, "PDFToXMLPage"))
  doc = as(doc, "XMLInternalDocument")
```

+ End up repeating this if() block in many functions.
  + replace everywhere with `doc = as(doc, "PDFToXMLDoc")`.
  + Easier to maintain and extend
  + Slightly more efficient.

+ Downside with as() is we cannot provide additional arguments to parameterize the creation.
  + e.g. `readPDFXML("contentNotFilename", asText = TRUE)` versus
         `as("contentNotFilename", "PDFToXMLDoc")`

---
# setAs()

+ Define two classes for temperature
   + Note: Not necessarily a good way to do this. See below
```
setClass("Celcius", contains = "numeric")
setClass("Faranheit", contains = "numeric")
```

```
setAs("Celcius", "Faranheit",
      function(from) {
        from * 1.8 + 32
      })
```

+ Can use as
```
cc = new("Celcius", c(0, 75, 100))
f = as(cc, "Faranheit")
class(f)
```

+ Problem, the result is not Faranheit
```
setAs("Celcius", "Faranheit",
      function(from) {
         new("Faranheit", from * 1.8 + 32)
      })
```


+ And define coercion method for other direction
```
setAs("Faranheit", "Celcius",
      function(from) {
         new("Celcius", (from - 32)/1.8)
      })
```


---
# Inheritance

+ Subclasses
  + B inherits from A
  + A is a superclass of B

+ Inherit the structure of the base/super class
  + Avoid repeating slots in definition

+ Establish relationship between classes
  + so instance/object of subclass can be used when instance of base class expected


+ Use contains parameter to specify subclass(es) 
```
setClass("TemperatureDegree", contains = "numeric")
setClass("Celcius", contains = "TemperatureDegree")
setClass("Faranheit", contains = "TemperatureDegree")
setClass("Kelvin", contains = "TemperatureDegree")
```

+ Now is() relationships between each of Celcius, Faranheit, Kelvin for TemperatureDegree
```
is(new("Celcius"), "TemperatureDegree")
```

---
# Inheritance


+ Define methods on base class
  + Don't need to repeat for each subclass
```
setMethod("plot", "TemperatureDegree",
          function(x, y, ...) {
            plot(density(x), ...)
          })
```

+ If we want to define method for subclass, we can
```
setMethod("plot", "Celcius", function(x, y, ...) {
    # Different computations
  })
```

+ So can override behavior of base class, or just use it.

+ Or override and reuse.

---
# callNextMethod()


+ Define a method for subclass
  + Invoke inherited method
  + add additional computations
```
setMethod("plot", "Celcius", function(x, y, ...) {
   callNextMethod()
   abline(v = c(0, 100))
})
```

+ Any changes to the base class method are automatically available.

+ We can do computations before and after the call to callNextMethod()

+ Analogous to but more flexible than S3's NextMethod()


---

# Has-A and Is-A

+ Difference between a class
   + having a slot that has class A, and
   + extending/inheriting from class A

---


# Virtual/Abstract Classes

+ Some classes in hierarchy intended to be used only as base classes.
   + e.g. TemperatureDegreee
   + Can't create a meaningful object of this type

+ Mark as VIRTUAL via
```
setClass("TemperatureDegree", contains = c("numeric", "VIRTUAL"))
setClass("Celcius", contains = "TemperatureDegree")
setClass("Faranheit", contains = "TemperatureDegree")
setClass("Kelvin", contains = "TemperatureDegree")
```

+ Attempt to create instance  of the class gives error
```
new("TemperatureDegree", c(1, 3, 10))
Error in new("TemperatureDegree", c(1, 3, 10)) : 
  trying to generate an object from a virtual class ("TemperatureDegree")
```

+ But very useful for
   + representing  concept
   + registering method for virtual class to be inherited by subclasses.

<!--


```
cc = new("Celcius", c(0, 75, 100))
```

```
is.numeric(cc)
```

```
f = as(cc, "Faranheit")
```

-->

---

# Multiple Inheritance
  + Can inherit from multiple classes simultaneous;
  + Order determines how we search for methods.

---
# Generic Functions in S4

+ If generic already defined, we can just add methods.

+ If function not defined, or defined but not a generic function,
  need to define generic version

+ To define a generic, setGeneric().
   + analogous to S3 UseMethod()

```
setGeneric("frame",
            function(x, y, ...)
```

+ Think about suitable name and how it may have other meanings
+ Think about what parameters are needed for all methods.
+ Allow additional parameters via `...`
---
# Methods

```
setMethod("nameOfGenericFun",
          signature,
          function(x, y, z, ...) {

          })
```

---

# Examples - Rtesseract

+ See setMethod.R

# Examples - Methods for [, with "missing"

+ Not missing value - NA, but argument is not present.

+ See setMethodMissing.R

# S4 in Packages

+ In NAMESPACE
  + import(methods)
  + exportClasses()
  + export(genericFuns)
  + exportMethods(fun1, fun2)

+ exportMethods() exports all methods for that function.

# Idiom for Writing Functions

+ Move expressions in the body to parameters
  + With default value being the expression from the body

+ Start writing a function
```
do = function(dir) {
   files = list.files(dir)
   info = file.info(files)
   dirs = files[info$isdir]
}
```
+ First off, what about additional parameters to list.files(), e.g. recursive = TRUE, full.names = TRUE
```
do = function(dir, ...) {
   files = list.files(dir, ...)
   info = file.info(files)
   dirs = files[info$isdir]
}
```

---
# Idiom for Writing Functions

+ What about moving the computations to parameters
```
do = function(dir, files = list.files(dir, ...),
              info = file.info(files),
              dirs = files[info$isdir], ...)
{
  # Nothing to do???!
}
```

+ Caller can
   + compute files, info once and pass these in repeated calls
     + useful when debugging.
   + can specify subset of dirs and limit computations

+ Can take this too far
   + No code in the body, or just a simple `return(dirs)`
